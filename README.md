# AVR2025-TextureSound

## 1. Project Title

**AVR2025 â€“ TextureSound: Multisensory VR Interaction with Materials through Haptics and Sound**

## 2. Project Description

"TextureSound" is an immersive VR application that explores how different surface properties (e.g., rough, smooth, soft) can be conveyed through a combination of visual impressions, vibration feedback, and corresponding audio cues.

The focus is on synchronized interaction between hand movement, the object, and the generated sensory feedback (sound and vibration).

## 3. Technical Implementation

- **Engine:** Unity (with XR Plug-in Management / OpenXR / Oculus Integration)
- **3D Modeling:** Blender 3D
- **Audio Processing:** Custom recordings & sound editing (e.g., Audacity)
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
- **Target Platform:** Meta Quest / PC-VR

## 4. Team Workflow

- GitHub for version control (cloning, branching, pull requests)
- Regular coordination for parallel development (e.g., modeling vs. sound design)
- Clearly defined responsibilities (haptics, audio, UI, interaction)
